# Klave-AI

A lightweight AssemblyScript application connecting your frontend to a powerful AI engine running within the Klave platform, bringing captivating AI-generated stories directly to your browser or application.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Klave-AI is an innovative solution that leverages the efficiency of **AssemblyScript** to create a seamless interface between your web-based or application frontend and a dedicated AI inference engine. This engine, powered by `llama2.c` (and soon `llama.cpp`), runs securely within the **Klave platform**, allowing you to integrate performant, pre-loaded Llama 2 story models for engaging user experiences.

This project is ideal for developers looking to:
* Integrate secure, local-like AI model inference directly into their applications.
* Explore lightweight and efficient frontend-to-WASM communication for AI workloads.
* Benefit from the Klave platform's managed AI inference environment.

---

## âœ¨ Features

* **WASI-NN API Compliance:** Designed to interact with the underlying AI engine via a **WASI-NN API-like interface**, promoting standardized and portable neural network operations within WebAssembly.
* **Klave-Powered Inference:** The `llama2.c` (and future `llama.cpp`) engine runs securely and efficiently within the **Klave platform**, handling model loading and execution.
* **AssemblyScript Bridge:** Efficient and performant connection between JavaScript/TypeScript frontends and the Klave-hosted AI engine.
* **Pre-loaded Story Models:** Interact with powerful, pre-loaded Llama 2 story models for on-demand AI generation.
* **Lightweight & Performant:** Designed for minimal overhead on the client side, providing a responsive user experience.
* **Context Management:** Manages execution contexts for different inference sessions, allowing for stateful interactions.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To integrate Klave-AI into your application and start generating stories, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of AssemblyScript and WebAssembly.
* Access to the Klave platform.

### Integration

1.  **Integrate the AssemblyScript Module:**
    Your frontend will communicate with the compiled AssemblyScript module. This module acts as the secure bridge to the AI engine running on Klave.
    *(You might want to add a very brief mention of how they'd get this module, e.g., "import the `klave-ai` package" or "load the provided WASM bundle.")*

2.  **Call Klave-AI Functions from your Frontend:**
    Utilize the exposed AssemblyScript functions to interact with the AI engine. These functions mirror the WASI-NN operations for loading models (though pre-loaded in Klave), adding prompts, and computing inference.

### Usage Example (Conceptual)

Once your frontend is connected, you can trigger AI generation:

1.  **Initialize an Execution Context:**
    Begin a new session for AI inference.
2.  **Add Your Prompt:**
    Provide the initial text or query to guide the story generation.
3.  **Retrieve Generated Pieces:**
    Continuously fetch generated text pieces until the story is complete or stopped.

The Klave platform handles the complexity of running the `llama2.c` engine and managing the models, providing a streamlined experience for your application.

## ðŸ”® Future Vision

While we currently demo integration with `llama2.c` for compelling story generation, this is just the beginning. Our roadmap includes significant advancements to expand Klave-AI's capabilities and ensure robust data privacy:

* **Expanded Model Support:** In the near future, we plan to shift to **`llama.cpp`** running within Klave, which will enable support for a broader range of models, including the powerful **Mistral series**. This will significantly enhance the diversity and sophistication of AI-generated content available to your applications.
* **Data Privacy with RAG:** We are deeply committed to protecting user data. Future iterations will incorporate **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** directly within the secure Klave environment. This strategic integration will allow the models to access and process information from private, secure data sources *without* exposing that data to the model itself or external services, ensuring your information remains confidential and under your control.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates as we continue to evolve Klave-AI into a versatile and secure AI solution!
